Instructions for loading and analyzing the LEEM test data set:

1. The main source directory for testing data sets is located in the main source tree under the directory 'TestData'
2. The LEEM data set is located in /TestData/LEEM/. The data files are located in /TestData/LEEM/Data/.
3. You will need to set the correct path in the 'Experiment.yaml' file located in /TestData/
    a. Open Experiment.yaml with any text editor
    b. You should see the line
        Data Path: "/Users/Maxwell/Desktop/Ru_UNH_LEEM/141023/141023_02_LEEM-IV_40FOV"
    c. Change this line to point to the directory /TestData/LEEM/Data/
        Data Path: "/Path/To/TestData/LEEM/Data/"

4. Run the PLEASE software package:
    python /path/to/source/main.py

5. Click the "Load Experiment" button on the left hand side of the application.
6. When the FileDialog opens, navigate to /TestData/LEEM/ and select Experiment.yaml, then press "OK".
7. When the data is finished loading you should see the data displayed in the LEEM Tab of the main UI.
      a. Moving the mouse over the data will plot I(V) curves on the right hand side from the mouse location.
      b. Left/Right Arrow keys move backwards and forwards through the image set.
      c. The energy of the current displayed image is shown above the image.
      d. The "Config" tab has settings for enabling data smoothing.
          i. Check the box for Enable Smoothing for LEEM Data
          ii. Select a smoothing window (Flat is the normal suggestion)
          iii. Enter the window length as an integer (typically 4-10)
          iV. Click "Apply Smoothing Settings"
          v. Click back to the LEEM data tab. Now I(V) data plotted will be automatically smoothed.

8. Outputting I(V) Data
    a. Clicking in the LEEM data image will create a new static plot window with the IV curve from your selection.
    b. Up to 10 I(V) curves can be displayed at a given time
    c. While IV curves are displayed in the popup window:
       a. Selecting "Output LEEM Data" will open a dialog to select a directory for file output.
       b. When outputting multiple I(V) curves, multiple files will be written with the same name
          simply appending a number to the end -> ivfile0.txt, ivfile1.txt, ivfile2.txt ...
       c. Files are written in tab delimited columnar form: E (eV) I (arb. units)



#####
Example:
(assuming you have the proper python version and dependencies installed)

1. Clone the PLEASE source code to your desktop (using git or manually downloading from website):
    git clone https://www.github.com/mgrady3/PLEASE

2. Navigate to the TestData directory in the source tree.
   Edit the file Experiment.yaml in /PLEASE/TestData/LEEM/ in any standard text editor

    Data Path: "/Path/To/Desktop/PLEASE/TestData/LEEM/Data" (note space after colon and path in quotes)

    Save and quit.

3. Start PLEASE
    python /Path/To/Desktop/PLEASE/source/main.py

4. Click Load Experiment

5. Navigate to /PLEASE/TestData/LEEM/ and Select Experiment.yaml, then press OK
